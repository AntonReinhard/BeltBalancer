# BeltBalancerCreator

This is going to be a program to create Belt Balancers for Factorio, there are many things not yet included like underground belts or side loading. I hope to add more stuff later but I can't gurantee anything.

# How To Use

At the moment Usage is not very intuitive... If you press '1' you get a normal Belt in your hand, if you press '2' you get a splitter, with 'r' you can rotate them and with 'q' you get a splitter or belt out of your hand again. If you hover over a Belt or Splitter the Program tells you, what ratios of a full belt come from which input. I hope to visualize what belt is what input in the future so it's easier to understand.
You can't delete or rotate stuff that's already placed yet, but I will probably do that.

Build 0.0.1:

- Basic Functionality of Belts and Splitters

Build 0.0.2:

- Fixed huge RAM Memory allocation (up to GB) when seeing the hover information of something too long

- Fixed initial content values for a newly placed Belt

- Hovering is only showing actually relevant inputs

- Can only place with left-click, right click deletes

To-Do:
Big Stuff:

- Underground Belts

- Some kind of Menu (probably like in factorio)

- Blueprintstring support (import/export)

- resizeable Window / settings in general

- side loading?

- sounds (indicating when you couldn't place something or if you placed something, etc.)

Small stuff:

- Fix hover information for splitters...

- Tidy Code (one step at a time)

- Make the Transparent image of belts in hand indicate, how it will look like, when placed (so it curves, when it is supposed to curve after placed)
